##Welcome to Callstack.io React Native Hackhaton.

###Case

In everyday office life we meet some problems. We are pretty sure that most of them can 
be easily solved with mobile app. Today we can fix them together. What can we use?
Of course react-native! Additionaly we have some things which were used in previous projects 
and may help us a bit:

- ⚙ `raspberry pi`,
- ⚙ two `sensors` connected with it *(`move` and `light`)*,
- ⚙ `API` which will provide you needed information to use them,
- ⚙ `beacons`,
- ⚙ rooms *(and not only)* have `qr codes` on them,


Here you have problems listed:

>Everytime I drive to office I wonder if this time I'll park my car on company's parking or no.

🆘 Is there any way to check parking place's availability before arriving to office ? 

>Urgent call ! F\**k someone is in conference room.

🆘 Eventhough we have another room which can be used for e-meetings would be good to know if it is booked 
(and maybe by who).

>Dratwa has the worst music taste ever! 😂

🆘 We would love to have perfect playlist. Rating for best proposals is always good way to choose.

> Where is the toilet ? How should I close office ?

🆘 New teammates are always welcome here ! But would be good to have crazy crazy way to onboard them.. 

> Who is garbage monster this week ?

🆘 Nobody wants to take out the garbage. But everyone have to and we have some schedule preapared (QR on trash bin).

###Cooperation

Ok so we will do it like this: Lets divide into 3 teams, our teammates will be in every of them to cooperate and support in case of need. Our CTO **@grabbou** is pretty busy but today he will be with us and don't waste this great opportunity to ask him most difficult question. He'll be glad to help ;P

###Rating

We do not have any strick rules about choosing winners. We should just fall in love with idea. The more problems you'll cover the better, the same if it comes to available devices but please remember - would be good to have something working.

Ok! Let's code!
